# WIT IMU Recording Processing with RTMaps
Please ensure the environment is fully set up before starting to publish data from the IMU sensor.

## Step 1: Software Checklist (Installation)
1. **Install MQTT Broker (Server)**
   - Install Mosquitto:
     - [mosquitto-2.0.18a-install-windows-x86](https://mosquitto.org/files/binary/win64/mosquitto-2.0.18-install-windows-x64.exe)
     - [mosquitto-2.0.18a-install-windows-x64](https://mosquitto.org/files/binary/win32/mosquitto-2.0.18-install-windows-x86.exe)
   - Configuration:
     - Update `mosquitto.conf`:
       - Replace `mosquitto.conf` with the file in the repo folder (`mqtt_server_mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`)
       - OR update `listener 1883` and `allow_anonymous true`
     - Set default user:
       - Example: `mosquitto_passwd -c pwfile.example admin`
2. **Install MQTT Service Test Tool (Optional)**
   - Install MQTTBox
3. **Install Python**
   - Packages: `pip install bleak paho-mqtt`
4. **Install RTMaps (Subscriber)**

## Step 2: Hardware Checklist
1. IMU (WIT-T901CL)

## Step 3: Turn on the MQTT Server
1. Open CMD and navigate to the Mosquitto folder (the server).
  `cd mosquitto`
2. In the root folder of Mosquitto, execute: 
  `mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf`
3. (Optional) Create a client and subscriber on MQTTBox. You will see the data stream under the topic.

## Step 4: Start Publishing Data from the Bluetooth IMU
1. Turn on the WIT IMU.
2. Wait for 10 seconds (initialization of the Bluetooth sensor).
3. In the IMU Python folder, execute: 
  `python bt2mqtt_publisher_imu_WITt901cl.py`
4. You will see the data log on the console.

## Step 5: Collect IMU Sensor Data
1. (Optional) Create a subscriber on MQTTBox. You will see the data stream under the topic.
2. Open the pre-set RTMaps and start recording data on the MQTT component.
